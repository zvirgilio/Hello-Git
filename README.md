## Notes

I had no idea how swift, xcode, or apps worked in general.  I spent a lot of my time searching for answers to questions so simple that most peopel didn't feel the need to post tutorials
Once I got through that, I had to learn how to use protocols and get comfortable with spending a lot of time reading Apple's documentation for all the goodies in UIKit.
